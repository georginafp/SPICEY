# Introduction

SPICEY is an R package designed to infer cell type specificity from single-cell omics data. It supports input from widely used frameworks such as Seurat (for single-cell RNA-seq) and Signac (for single-cell ATAC-seq), and computes metrics of cell-type specificity at both the regulatory and transcriptional levels.

## Preamble

SPICEY is designed to operate on the results of differential analyses performed on either single-cell ATAC-seq (for chromatin accessibility) or single-cell RNA-seq (for gene expression) data. These analyses would compare each feature—either a regulatory element (e.g., peak) or gene—across cell types to identify cell-type-specific activity or expression. SPICEY takes advantage of the resulting statistics, specifically the **log2 fold-change** and associated **adjusted p-values**, which reflect both the magnitude and statistical confidence of differential activity. By leveraging these pre-computed differential results, SPICEY quantifies cell-type specificity through composite metrics that capture both the strength and selectivity of feature enrichment in individual cell types.

## Cell-Type Specificity Indices: RETSI and GETSI

SPICEY introduces two complementary metrics:

-   RETSI (Regulatory Element Tissue Specificity Index): Quantifies the cell-type specificity of regulatory regions between cell types (e.g., ATAC-seq peaks).

<!-- -->

-   GETSI (Gene Expression Tissue Specificity Index): Quantifies the specificity of gene expression across distinct cell types.

Both RETSI and GETSI are calculated using a weighted specificity score for each feature (regulatory region or gene), defined as:

$$
TSI_{i,x} = \frac{FC_{i,x}}{\max(FC)_x} \cdot w_{i,x}
$$

$$
w_{i,x} = \text{rescale}\left( -\log_{10}(padj_{i,x}),\ [0, 1] \right)
$$

where:

-   $i$ is a specific cell type
-   $x \in \{r, g\}$, with $r$ for regulatory region (RETSI) and $g$ for gene (GETSI)
-   $\text{FC}_{i,x}$ is the log fold-change of feature $x$ in cell type $i$
-   $w_{i,x}$ is the weight term, defined as the rescaled value of $-\log_{10}(\text{adjusted } p\text{-value})$ between 0 and 1

Additionally, SPICEY supports the integration of regulatory elements with their putative target genes using multiple linking strategies, including:

-   Nearest-gene assignment
-   Co-accessibility-based linking (when co-accessibility links are available)

These linking approaches enable SPICEY to combine regulatory specificity (RETSI) and gene expression specificity (GETSI), facilitating integrated analyses of gene regulatory architecture at single-cell resolution.

This vignette demonstrates how to use SPICEY with preprocessed GRanges input files. These input files must be prepared in advance (not provided by the package).

## Entropy-based specificity indices

To complement fold change-based indices, SPICEY also quantifies **the distributional skewness** of features using **Shannon entropy**. For each regulatory region or gene, activity or expression values across all NNN cell types are converted into a probability distribution:

$$
H = - \sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i \log_2(p_i)
$$

$$
H_{norm} = 1 - e^{H}
$$

where:

-   $p_{i,x} = \frac{a_{i,x}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{j,x}}$ is the normalized activity or expression of feature $x$ across $N$ cell types
-   $a_{i,x}$ is the activity (for RETSI) or expression (for GETSI) value in cell type \$\$
-   $H_x$ is the Shannon entropy, and Normalized Entropy ranges between 0 (cell type specific) and 1 (cell type shared).

# Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```{r install, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("georginafp/SPICEY")
```

# Input Requirements

SPICEY requires carefully prepared input files representing processed single-cell omics data, specifically from differential analyses of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and/or gene expression (RNA-seq). These inputs are **not provided** within the package and must be generated externally beforehand. Below is a detailed description of each required input and the necessary metadata.

## Single cell ATAC-seq data

-   **Format:** A list of `GRanges` objects or `data.frame`s (convertible to `GRanges`), where each element represents differential accessible sites for a specific cell type.

-   **Required columns (for each element of the list):**

    -   `seqnames`, `start`, `end` — genomic coordinates of the peak.

    -   `avg_log2FC` — average log2 fold-change of chromatin accessibility for the peak in a specific cell type (output from differential accessibility analysis).

    -   `p_val` — raw or adjusted p-value corresponding to the differential accessibility test for the peak (output from differential accessibility analysis).

    -   `cell_type` — cell type or cluster label associated with each differential measurement.

The ATAC peaks input must include multiple rows per peak representing differential statistics for each cell type. For example, the same peak may appear with different `avg_log2FC`, `p_val`, and `cell_type` values reflecting its differential accessibility in each cell type.

```{r da-atac, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data("atac")
```

## Single cell RNA-seq data

-   **Format:** A list of `GRanges` objects or `data.frame`s (convertible to `GRanges`), where each element represents differential gene expression results for a specific cell type.

-   **Required columns (for each element of the list):**

    -   `gene_id` — gene identifier column, which must have the **same name** across all list elements (e.g., official gene symbol).

    -   `avg_log2FC` — average log2 fold-change of chromatin accessibility for the peak in a specific cell type (output from differential accessibility analysis).

    -   `p_val` — raw or adjusted p-value corresponding to the differential accessibility test for the peak (output from differential accessibility analysis).

    -   `cell_type` — cell type or cluster label associated with each differential measurement.

The RNA input must include multiple rows per gene representing differential statistics for each cell type. For example, the same gene may appear with different `avg_log2FC`, `p_val`, and `cell_type` values reflecting its differential expression in each cell type.

```{r da-rna, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data("rna")
```

## Co-accessibility Links (optional, for region-to-gene linking mode)

-   **Purpose:** To link regulatory elements based on co-accessibility inferred from tools like Signac’s `LinkPeaks()`. This supports integrative analysis of regulatory elements and gene expression. Only required if `annot_method = "coaccessibility"` is defined.

-   **Format:**

    -   Either a `GInteractions` or a `GRangesList` object with metadata columns.

<!-- -->

-   **Required columns:**

    -   `Peaks1` — genomic coordinate or ID of the first peak in the pair.

    -   `Peaks2` — genomic coordinate or ID of the second peak linked by co-accessibility.

    -   `coaccess` — co-accessibility score or correlation value.

    -   `CCAN1`, `CCAN2` — CCAN (co-accessibility network) identifiers for the peaks.

The peaks referenced here must match exactly those in the ATAC peaks input (same coordinates or peak IDs).

```{r links, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data("cicero_links")
head(cicero_links)
```

This section demonstrates how to run SPICEY using prepared input files, as described in earlier sections.

## Computing RETSI

To calculate the **Regulatory Element Tissue Specificity Index (RETSI)**, the following input is required:

getsi <- spicey_getsi(rna, gene_id = "gene_id")
head(getsi)
```

## Annotating Regulatory Elements to Target Genes (optional)

SPICEY allows annotating regulatory elements to their putative target genes using two different methodologies:

### Annotate to nearest gene

This mode links each regulatory region to its nearest gene TSS.

#### Required inputs:

-   `retsi`: Output from `spicey_retsi()`, containing RETSI values

-   `annot_method`: Set to `"nearest"`

-   `txdb`: A `TxDb` object with gene models

-   `annot_dbi`: AnnotationDbi object (e.g., `org.Hs.eg.db`) to add gene metadata

#### Optional parameters:

-   `filter_promoter_distal`: Exclude promoter-proximal regions (default: `TRUE`)

-   `filter_protein_coding`: Limit to protein-coding genes (default: `TRUE`)

-   `keep_mito`: Retain mitochondrial peaks (default: `FALSE`)

-   `add_tss_annotation`: Include TSS distance and related columns (default: `FALSE`)

-   `link_spicey_measures`: Join RETSI and GETSI scores by gene (default: `FALSE`)

-   `verbose`: Display progress (default: `TRUE`)

```{r re-gene-nearest, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene::TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene
retsi_gene_nearest <- annotate_with_nearest(
  retsi = retsi,
  txdb = txdb, 
  annot_dbi = org.Hs.eg.db::org.Hs.eg.db
)

head(retsi_gene_nearest)
```

### Annotate to co-accessibile genes

This mode links regulatory regions to genes via co-accessibility interactions, which must be computed externally (e.g., using **Cicero** or **Signac**).

#### Required inputs:

-   `retsi`: Output from `spicey_retsi()`, containing RETSI values

-   `annot_method`: Set to `"coaccessibility"`

-   `links`: A `data.frame`, `GRangesList`, or Cicero/ArchR-style object with co-accessibility links

-   `coaccess_cutoff_override`: Minimum co-accessibility score (default: `0.25`)

#### Optional parameters:

-   `filter_promoter_distal`: Exclude promoter-proximal regions (default: `TRUE`)

-   `filter_protein_coding`: Limit to protein-coding genes (default: `TRUE`)

-   `keep_mito`: Retain mitochondrial peaks (default: `FALSE`)

-   `add_tss_annotation`: Include TSS distance and related columns (default: `FALSE`)

-   `link_spicey_measures`: Join RETSI and GETSI scores by gene (default: `FALSE`)

-   `verbose`: Display progress (default: `TRUE`)

```{r re-gene-coaccessibility, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene::TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene

# Filter links for high coaccessibility score
coacc_links <- cicero_links |> 
  dplyr::filter(coaccess > 0.5)

retsi_gene_coacc <- annotate_with_coaccessibility(
  links = coacc_links,
  retsi = retsi,
  txdb = txdb, 
  annot_dbi = org.Hs.eg.db::org.Hs.eg.db,
  coaccess_cutoff_override = 0.25
  )

head(retsi_gene_coacc)
```

## Linking RETSI and GETSI Scores to Build Tissue-Specific Regulatory Networks (optional)

To construct an integrated regulatory network that links RETSI and GETSI scores, SPICEY allows you to associate both scores at the gene level using either annotation strategy:

### Using nearest gene annotation

-   `retsi_gene_nearest`: Output from `annotate_with_nearest()`, linking peaks to nearest genes with RETSI scores

-   `getsi`: Output from `spicey_getsi()`, providing GETSI scores for genes

```{r spicey-nearest, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
spicey_nearest <- link_spicey_nearest(retsi_gene_nearest, getsi)
head(spicey_nearest)
```

### Using co-accessible gene annotation

-   `retsi_gene_coacc`: Output from `annotate_with_coaccessibility()`, linking peaks to co-accessible genes with RETSI scores

-   `getsi`: Output from `spicey_getsi()`, providing GETSI scores for genes

By integrating RETSI and GETSI, SPICEY enables comprehensive analysis of tissue-specific regulatory logic at both the epigenetic and transcriptional levels.

```{r spicey-coaccessibility, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
spicey_coacc <- link_spicey_coaccessible(retsi_gene_coacc, getsi)
head(spicey_coacc)
```

# Example: Run SPICEY whole pipeline

## Overview

While SPICEY provides modular functions—such as `spicey_retsi()`, `spicey_getsi()`, and `annotate_with_nearest()`—for users who prefer fine-grained control, it also includes a wrapper function, `run_spicey()`, that streamlines the full workflow into a single, reproducible step.

This wrapper automatically determines which operations to perform based on the input data and parameters provided, making it ideal for users seeking a quick, end-to-end analysis without manually managing each intermediate step.

When supplied with differential accessibility (ATAC) and/or gene expression (RNA) data, and a gene-linking strategy ("nearest" or "coaccessibility"), `run_spicey()` performs the following operations as needed:

-   **RETSI computation** (if ATAC data is provided)

-   **GETSI computation** (if RNA data is provided)

-   **Annotation of regulatory regions to target genes**, via:

    -   `"nearest"` gene TSS or

    -   `"coaccessibility"` links (e.g., from Cicero or ArchR)

-   **Linking RETSI and GETSI scores by gene** (if `link_spicey_measures = TRUE`)

The function returns a structured list containing all intermediate and final outputs, making it easy to inspect and reuse individual components of the pipeline.

For users who prefer to run each step independently—for example, to apply custom filters or transformations—each module remains fully accessible and can be run separately.

## Output

The following output is a `data frame` object containing **genomic regions**, each representing a regulatory element (e.g., enhancer or promoter) annotated with multiple metadata columns. These columns provide statistical, biological, and functional information derived from chromatin accessibility and gene expression data: 

| Column | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `seqnames` | Chromosome name (e.g., `chr7`, `chr17`) where the region is located. |
| `ranges` | Genomic coordinates (start–end) of the regulatory region. |
| `strand` | Strand information (`*` means unstranded, typical for regulatory elements). |
| `width` | Length of the genomic region in base pairs. |
| `cell_type` | The specific cell type where the region shows significant accessibility (e.g., `"Acinar"`). |
| `p_val_adj` | Adjusted p-value from differential accessibility testing (multiple testing corrected). Small values indicate high significance. |
| `p_val` | Raw p-value from differential accessibility testing. |
| `avg_log2FC` | Average log2 fold-change in accessibility in the indicated cell type versus others; higher values indicate greater specificity. |
| `region` | Genomic interval as a string (e.g., `"chr7:142748901-142749963"`). |
| `RETSI` | Regulatory Element Tissue Specificity Index; values near 1 indicate high specificity of accessibility to this cell type. |
| `RETSI_entropy` | Entropy-based measure of specificity, with lower values indicating more cell-type-specific accessibility. |
| `genes_HPAP, genes_nearest` | Names of genes linked to the regulatory region using co-accessibility or nearest-gene annotation. |
| `GETSI` | Gene Expression Tissue Specificity Index for linked genes, indicating how specific gene expression is to the cell type. |
| `GETSI_entropy` | Entropy-based measure of gene expression specificity, similar to RETSI entropy but applied at the transcript level. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This annotated `data frame` object thus serves as a comprehensive resource combining genomic location, cell type-specific accessibility, gene linkage, and expression specificity — facilitating downstream functional genomics analyses.
