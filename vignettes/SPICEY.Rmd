# Introduction

SPICEY is an R package designed to infer cell type specificity from single-cell omics data. It supports input from widely used frameworks such as Seurat (for single-cell RNA-seq) and Signac (for single-cell ATAC-seq), and computes metrics of cell-type specificity at both the regulatory and transcriptional levels.

## Preamble

SPICEY is designed to operate on the results of differential analyses performed on either single-cell ATAC-seq (for chromatin accessibility) or single-cell RNA-seq (for gene expression) data. These analyses would compare each feature—either a regulatory element (e.g., peak) or gene—across cell types to identify cell-type-specific activity or expression. SPICEY takes advantage of the resulting statistics, specifically the **log2 fold-change** and associated **adjusted p-values**, which reflect both the magnitude and statistical confidence of differential activity. By leveraging these pre-computed differential results, SPICEY quantifies cell-type specificity through composite metrics that capture both the strength and selectivity of feature enrichment in individual cell types.

## Cell-Type Specificity Indices: RETSI and GETSI

SPICEY introduces two complementary metrics:

-   RETSI (Regulatory Element Tissue Specificity Index): Quantifies the cell-type specificity of regulatory regions between cell types (e.g., ATAC-seq peaks).

<!-- -->

-   GETSI (Gene Expression Tissue Specificity Index): Quantifies the specificity of gene expression across distinct cell types.

Both RETSI and GETSI are calculated using a weighted specificity score for each feature (regulatory region or gene), defined as:

$$
TSI_{i,x} = \frac{FC_{i,x}}{\max(FC)_x} \cdot w_{i,x}
$$

$$
w_{i,x} = \text{rescale}\left( -\log_{10}(padj_{i,x}),\ [0, 1] \right)
$$

where:

-   $i$ is a specific cell type
-   $x \in \{r, g\}$, with $r$ for regulatory region (RETSI) and $g$ for gene (GETSI)
-   $\text{FC}_{i,x}$ is the log fold-change of feature $x$ in cell type $i$
-   $w_{i,x}$ is the weight term, defined as the rescaled value of $-\log_{10}(\text{adjusted } p\text{-value})$ between 0 and 1

Additionally, SPICEY supports the integration of regulatory elements with their putative target genes using multiple linking strategies, including:

-   Nearest-gene assignment
-   Co-accessibility-based linking (when co-accessibility links are available)

These linking approaches enable SPICEY to combine regulatory specificity (RETSI) and gene expression specificity (GETSI), facilitating integrated analyses of gene regulatory architecture at single-cell resolution.

This vignette demonstrates how to use SPICEY with preprocessed GRanges input files. These input files must be prepared in advance (not provided by the package).

## **Entropy-based specificity indices**

To complement fold change-based indices, SPICEY also quantifies **the distributional skewness** of features using **Shannon entropy**. For each regulatory region or gene, activity or expression values across all NNN cell types are converted into a probability distribution:

$$
H = - \sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i \log_2(p_i)
$$

$$
H_{norm} = 1 - e^{H}
$$

where:

-   $p_{i,x} = \frac{a_{i,x}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{j,x}}$ is the normalized activity or expression of feature $x$ across $N$ cell types
-   $a_{i,x}$ is the activity (for RETSI) or expression (for GETSI) value in cell type \$\$
-   $H_x$ is the Shannon entropy, and Normalized Entropy ranges between 0 (cell type specific) and 1 (cell type shared).

# Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```{r install, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("georginafp/SPICEY")

```

# Input Requirements

SPICEY requires carefully prepared input files representing processed single-cell omics data, specifically from differential analyses of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and/or gene expression (RNA-seq). These inputs are **not provided** within the package and must be generated externally beforehand. Below is a detailed description of each required input and the necessary metadata.

## 1. Single cell ATAC-seq data

-   **Format:** `GRanges` or `data.frame` convertible to `GRanges`

-   **Required columns:**

    -   `seqnames`, `start`, `end` — genomic coordinates of the peak.

    -   `avg_log2FC` — average log2 fold-change of chromatin accessibility for the peak in a specific cell type (output from differential accessibility analysis).

    -   `p_val` — raw or adjusted p-value corresponding to the differential accessibility test for the peak (output from differential accessibility analysis).

    -   `cell_type` — cell type or cluster label associated with each differential measurement.

-   **Optional columns:**

    -   `annotation` — genomic annotation of the peak (e.g., promoter, enhancer)

    -   `distanceToTSS` — distance from peak to nearest transcription start site.

    -   `nearest_gene` — gene symbol/name of the closest gene to the peak. Required for linking regulatory elements based on the nearest gene.

The **ATAC peaks input** must include **multiple rows per peak** representing differential statistics for each cell type. For example, the same peak may appear with different `avg_log2FC`, `p_val`, and `cell_type` values reflecting its differential accessibility in each cell type.

```{r show-da-atac, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
data("atac")
```

## 2. Single cell RNA-seq data

-   **Format:** `GRanges` or `data.frame` convertible to `GRanges`

-   **Required columns:**

    -   `seqnames`, `start`, `end` — genomic coordinates of the gene

    -   `avg_log2FC` — average log2 fold-change of chromatin accessibility for the peak in a specific cell type (output from differential accessibility analysis).

    -   `p_val` — raw or adjusted p-value corresponding to the differential accessibility test for the peak (output from differential accessibility analysis).

    -   `cell_type` — cell type or cluster label associated with each differential measurement.

-   **Optional columns:**

    -   `symbol` — identifier of the gene (official gene symbol). Required for linking regulatory elements based on the nearest gene.

The RNA input must represent differential expression results, i.e., statistics computed for each gene across cell types.

```{r show-da-rna, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
data("rna")
```

## 3. Co-accessibility Links (optional, for region to gene linking mode)

-   **Purpose:** To link regulatory elements based on co-accessibility inferred from tools like Signac’s `LinkPeaks()`. This supports integrative analysis of regulatory elements and gene expression.

-   **Format:**

    -   Either a `GInteractions` or a `GRangesList` object with metadata columns.

<!-- -->

-   **Required columns:**

    -   `Peaks1` — genomic coordinate or ID of the first peak in the pair.

    -   `Peaks2` — genomic coordinate or ID of the second peak linked by co-accessibility.

    -   `coaccess` — co-accessibility score or correlation value.

    -   `CCAN1`, `CCAN2` — CCAN (co-accessibility network) identifiers for the peaks.

The peaks referenced here **must match** exactly those in the ATAC peaks input (same coordinates or peak IDs).

```{r links, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
data("cicero_links")
head(cicero_links)
```

# Example: Run SPICEY step-by-step

We demonstrate how to use SPICEY with the prepared input files (explained in previous sections).

## RETSI

```{r retsi, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
retsi <- spicey_retsi(atac)
head(retsi)
```

```{r show-retsi, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
data("retsi")
head(retsi)
```

## GETSI

```{r getsi, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
getsi <- spicey_getsi(rna)
```

```{r show-getsi, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
data("getsi")
head(getsi)
```

## Linking regulatory regions to target genes

### Nearest gene mode

```{r re-gene-nearest, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
retsi_gene_nearest <- annotate_with_nearest(retsi)
```

```{r show-re-gene-nearest, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
data("retsi_gene_nearest")
head(retsi_gene_nearest)
```

This mode links each peak to the nearest gene TSS.

### Co-accessibility mode

```{r re-gene-coaccessibility, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Filter links for high coaccessibility score
coacc_links <- cicero_links |> 
  dplyr::filter(coaccess > 0.5)

# Annotate links with CCANs and filter for Promoter-Distal interactions
links <- annotate_links_with_ccans(
  links = coacc_links,
  coaccess_cutoff_override = 0.25,
  filter_promoter_distal = TRUE,
  txdb = TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene::TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene)

retsi_gene_coacc <- annotate_with_coaccessibility(
  re = retsi,
  links = links,
  txdb = TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene::TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene,
  name_links = "HPAP")

```

```{r show-re-gene-coacc, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
data("retsi_gene_coacc")
head(retsi_gene_coacc)
```

## Tissue specific regulatory networks

By associating both SPICEY measures:

### Using nearest gene annotation method

```{r spicey-nearest, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
spicey_nearest <- link_spicey_nearest(retsi_gene_nearest, getsi)
head(spicey_nearest)
```

### Using co-accessibility annotation method

```{r spicey-coaccessibility, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
spicey_coacc <- link_spicey_coaccessible(retsi_gene_coacc, getsi)
head(spicey_coacc)
```

# Example: Run SPICEY whole pipeline

While each step of the SPICEY workflow—such as computing RETSI, GETSI, or performing linking methods—can be run independently using their respective functions (as described in previous sections), we have also developed a convenient wrapper function `run_spicey()` that streamlines the entire analysis into a single call, automatically handling all necessary computations based on the input data provided.

This approach is especially useful for users who want to execute the full pipeline in a straightforward and reproducible manner, without manually managing each intermediate step. It accepts ATAC and/or RNA differential analysis results data as input, and optionally a linking method ("nearest" or "coaccessibility") along with required additional inputs (e.g., links for coaccessibility). Depending on which data and parameters are supplied, the function dynamically performs:

-   **RETSI** calculation (when ATAC data is provided).
-   **GETSI** calculation (when RNA data is provided).
-   **Linking regulatory elements to target genes** (if both data types and a linking method are provided).

By returning all intermediate and final results in a structured list, this wrapper allows users to easily access and inspect each step’s output if desired.

For users who prefer detailed control and tracking of each step, running the component functions separately remains fully supported and encouraged.

**Arguments**

# Compute GETSI 
results <- run_spicey(rna = rna)

# Compute RETSI
results <- run_spicey(atac=atac)

# Compute GETSI + RETSI
results <- run_spicey(atac=atac, rna=rna)

# Compute GETSI + RETSI and link RE to target genes through nearest gene method
results <- run_spicey(rna = rna, atac=atac, link_method = "nearest")

# Compute GETSI + RETSI and link RE to target genes through coaccessibility method
results <- run_spicey(
  atac = atac_data,
  rna = rna_data,
  link_method = "coaccessibility",
  links = coaccessibility_links,
  coaccess_cutoff_override = 0.25,  
  filter_promoter_distal = TRUE    
)

```

# Output

The following output is a `GRanges` object containing **genomic regions** (ranges), each representing a regulatory element (e.g., enhancer or promoter) annotated with multiple metadata columns. These columns provide statistical, biological, and functional information derived from chromatin accessibility and gene expression data.

### Metadata Columns Description

| Column | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `seqnames` | Chromosome name (e.g., `chr7`, `chr17`) where the region is located. |
| `ranges` | Genomic coordinates (start–end) of the regulatory region. |
| `strand` | Strand information (`*` means unstranded, typical for regulatory elements). |
| `width` | Length of the genomic region in base pairs. |
| `cell_type` | The specific cell type where the region shows significant accessibility (e.g., `"Acinar"`). |
| `p_val_adj` | Adjusted p-value from differential accessibility testing (multiple testing corrected). Small values indicate high significance. |
| `p_val` | Raw p-value from differential accessibility testing. |
| `avg_log2FC` | Average log2 fold-change in accessibility in the indicated cell type versus others; higher values indicate greater specificity. |
| `region` | Genomic interval as a string (e.g., `"chr7:142748901-142749963"`). |
| `RETSI` | Regulatory Element Tissue Specificity Index; values near 1 indicate high specificity of accessibility to this cell type. |
| `RETSI_entropy` | Entropy-based measure of specificity, with lower values indicating more cell-type-specific accessibility. |
| `genes_HPAP, genes_nearest` | Names of genes linked to the regulatory region using co-accessibility or nearest-gene annotation. |
| `GETSI` | Gene Expression Tissue Specificity Index for linked genes, indicating how specific gene expression is to the cell type. |
| `GETSI_entropy` | Entropy-based measure of gene expression specificity, similar to RETSI entropy but applied at the transcript level. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This annotated `GRanges` object thus serves as a comprehensive resource combining genomic location, cell type-specific accessibility, gene linkage, and expression specificity — facilitating downstream functional genomics analyses.
