\title{Compute GETSI scores and entropy from RNA-seq data}
\usage{
spicey_getsi(rna_da)
}
\arguments{
\item{rna_da}{A named list of GRanges objects, typically one per cell type,
containing RNA differential expression data with columns such as
avg_log2FC, p_val, symbol, etc.}
}
\value{
A GRanges object with GETSI scores and entropy values in the
metadata columns.
}
\description{
Computes gene expression tissue specificity (GETSI) scores and
entropy from RNA-seq data. The input should be a named list of
GRanges objects, each containing differential expression data for
one cell type.
