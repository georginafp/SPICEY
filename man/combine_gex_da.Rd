\title{Combine Differential Expression Results Across Cell Types}
\usage{
combine_gex_da(rna_da, gene_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{rna_da}{A named list of data frames. Each element corresponds to a cell type
and contains differential expression results with genes as row names.}

\item{gene_id}{A string indicating the name of the column in each data frame
that contains gene identifiers (e.g., gene symbols).}
}
\value{
A single data frame combining all input differential expression results
with added columns for gene ids and cell types.
}
\description{
This function takes a list of differential expression data frames (from scRNA-seq)
for multiple cell types and combines them into a single annotated data frame.
Each data frame should contain gene-level statistics (e.g., log2FC, p-value).
}
