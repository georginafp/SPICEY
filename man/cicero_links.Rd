\title{Example Cicero co-accessibility links}
\format{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{Peak1}{Genomic coordinate or peak identifier for the first peak in the pair}
\item{Peak2}{Genomic coordinate or peak identifier for the second peak in the pair}
\item{coaccess}{Co-accessibility score or correlation value quantifying the linkage}
}
}
\source{
Simulated Cicero co-accessibility results on example single-cell ATAC-seq data.
}
\usage{
data(cicero_links)
}
\description{
A simulated example dataset of co-accessibility links inferred
from single-cell ATAC-seq data using tools such as Cicero or Signac's LinkPeaks().
These links support integrative analysis by associating regulatory elements
with putative target genes. The peaks referenced here must exactly match
those in the ATAC-seq differential accessibility dataset.
