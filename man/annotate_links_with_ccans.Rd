\title{Annotate co-accessible links with CCAN membership}
\usage{
annotate_links_with_ccans(
  links,
  coaccess_cutoff_override = 0.25,
  tolerance_digits = 2,
  filter_promoter_distal = TRUE,
  txdb = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{links}{A \code{data.frame} of co-accessibility links with at least three columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{Peak1}}{Character vector specifying the first peak in the
co-accessibility link. Each peak is typically represented as a
genomic coordinate string, e.g., "chr1-123456-123789".}
\item{\code{Peak2}}{Character vector specifying the second peak in the
co-accessibility link, in the same format as \code{Peak1}.}
\item{\code{coaccess}}{Numeric vector representing the co-accessibility
score between \code{Peak1} and \code{Peak2}.
This score quantifies the strength of coordinated accessibility between the
two peaks, where higher values indicate stronger putative regulatory interaction.}}}

\item{coaccess_cutoff_override}{Numeric; co-accessibility score cutoff used
for defining CCAN membership clusters. Peaks connected by edges with co-accessibility
scores above this threshold will be clustered together (default: \code{0.25}).}

\item{tolerance_digits}{Integer; number of decimal digits to round co-accessibility
scores when detecting CCAN clusters. This controls the precision of clustering (default: \code{2}).}

\item{filter_promoter_distal}{Logical; whether to filter links to keep only those connecting
promoter regions to distal elements (default: \code{TRUE}). Promoter regions are defined
based on the provided \code{txdb} annotation.}

\item{txdb}{A \code{TxDb} object (from \pkg{GenomicFeatures}) representing genome annotation.
This is used to identify promoter regions when filtering promoter-distal links. Can be created using
\code{GenomicFeatures::makeTxDbFromGFF()} or a prebuilt TxDb package like \code{TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene}.}
}
\value{
A \code{GInteractions} object where each row corresponds to a co-accessible peak pair,
with the following metadata columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{coaccess}}{Co-accessibility score between \code{Peak1} and \code{Peak2}.}
\item{\code{CCAN1}}{Identifier of the CCAN (co-accessibility network cluster)
that \code{Peak1} belongs to. CCANs group highly connected peaks based on co-accessibility.}
\item{\code{CCAN2}}{Identifier of the CCAN cluster that \code{Peak2} belongs to.}}
}
\description{
Processes co-accessibility links to assign CCAN (co-accessibility network)
membership to each peak. Optionally filters links to retain only promoter-distal
interactions, and converts the result to a \code{GInteractions} object annotated
with co-accessibility scores and CCAN metadata.
