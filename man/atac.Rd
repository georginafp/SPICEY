\title{Example single-cell ATAC-seq differential accessibility data}
\format{
A data frame or GRanges-like object with the following required columns:
\describe{
\item{seqnames}{Chromosome name (e.g., "chr1")}
\item{start}{Start coordinate of the peak}
\item{end}{End coordinate of the peak}
\item{avg_log2FC}{Average log2 fold-change in accessibility for the peak in the specific cell type}
\item{p_val}{Raw or adjusted p-value from differential accessibility analysis}
\item{cell_type}{Cell type label associated with the differential measurement}
}
Multiple rows may exist per peak, each for a different cell type.

\description{
A toy or example dataset representing single-cell ATAC-seq differential analysis results.
Each row corresponds to a chromatin peak assessed for differential accessibility across one or more cell types.
