\title{Example single-cell RNA-seq differential expression data}
\format{
A data frame or \code{GRanges}-like object with the following required columns:
\describe{
\item{gene_id}{Gene identifier (e.g., official gene symbol or Ensembl ID)}
\item{avg_log2FC}{Average log2 fold-change of expression for the gene in the specific cell type}
\item{p_val}{Raw or adjusted p-value from differential expression testing}
\item{cell_type}{Cell type or cluster label associated with each measurement}
}
}
\source{
Simulated single-cell RNA-seq differential expression data used in SPICEY examples.
}
\usage{
data(rna)
}
\description{
A simulated example dataset representing single-cell RNA-seq
differential expression results.
Each row corresponds to a gene tested across one or more cell types.
The dataset is formatted as a list of \code{GRanges} objects or
data frames (convertible to \code{GRanges}), where each element contains
differential expression statistics for a specific cell type.
Multiple rows may exist per gene, each representing results in a different cell type.
