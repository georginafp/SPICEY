#' SPICEY: Tissue specificity analysis for single-cell data

#' The SPICEY package provides a user-friendly pipeline for quantifying and
#' visualizing tissue specificity specificity from single-cell ATAC-seq and/or
#' single cell RNA-seq datasets, typically processed with tools such as Seurat or Signac.
#' The core outputs of SPICEY are two tissue specific metrics, combined with entropy-based measures.
